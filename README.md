# glbinding

*glbinding* is a generated C++ binding for OpenGL which is solely based on the new xml-based OpenGL API specification (gl.xml). It is a fully fledged OpenGL API binding compatible with current code based on other C bindings, e.g., [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) or [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad). The binding is generated using python scripts and templates, that can be easily adapted to fit custom needs.

*glbinding* leverages modern C++11 features like enum classes, lambdas, and variadic templates, instead of relying on macros (all OpenGL symbols are real functions and variables). It provides [type-safe parameters](#type-safe-parameters), [per feature API header](#per-feature-api-header), [lazy function resolving](#lazy-function-resolving), [multi-context](#multi-context-support) and [multi-thread](#multi-thread-support) support, [global](#global-callbacks) and [local](#local-callbacks) function callbacks, [meta information](#meta-information) about the generated OpenGL binding and the OpenGL runtime, as well as multiple [examples](#examples) for quick-starting your projects. 

Current code written with a typical C binding for OpenGL is fully compatible for the use with *glbinding*.
Just replace all includes to the old binding and use the appropriate api namespace, e.g., ```gl```: 

```
#include <glbinding/gl/gl.h>
#include <glbinding/Binding.h>

using namespace gl;

int main()
{
  // create context, e.g. using GLFW, Qt, SDL, GLUT, ...

  glbinding::Binding::initialize();

  glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);
  // ...
  glEnd();
}
```

## Features

##### Type-Safe Parameters

Every parameter of an OpenGL function expects a specific type of value and *glbinding* enforces the type in its function interfaces.
This results in the following behavior:
```
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT); // valid
glClear(GL_FRAMEBUFFER); // compile error: bitfield of group ClearBufferMask expected, got GLenum
```
For bitfields there are extensively specified groups that are additionally used to enforce type-safety (a bitfield value can be used by several groups).
Combinations of bitfields that share no group results in a compile error.
```
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT); // valid
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_MAP_READ_BIT); // compile error: both bitfields share no group
glClear(GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT | GL_LIGHTING_BIT); // compile error: bitwise or operation is valid (shared group is AttribMask), but the resulting bitfield group does not match with the expected in glClear
```
The groups for enums are not as complety as they are needed - e.g. ```GL_VERTEX_SHADER``` is in the group ```ShaderType``` and ```GL_COMPUTE_SHADER``` is not - to enable per function compile time errors when trying to call functions with values from the wrong enum group.

Another feature of type-safe parameters is the possible IDE support.
If your IDE has support for it, the code completion can hint the set of currently valid values.

##### Per Feature API Header

Enums, bitfields, and functions can be included as usual in a combined ```gl.h``` header or individually via ```bitfield.h```, ```enum.h```, and ```functions.h``` respectively. Additionally, these headers are available for  featured-based API subsets, each using a specialized namespace, e.g.:
* ```functions32.h``` provides all OpenGL commands available up to 3.2 in namespace ```gl32```.
* ```functions32core.h``` provides all non-deprecated OpenGL commands available up to 3.2 in namespace ```gl32core```.
* ```functions32ext.h``` provides all OpenGL commands specified either in 3.3 and above, or by extension in ```gl32ext```.

Depending on the intended use-case, this allows to (1) limit coding to a specific OpenGL feature and (2) reduces switching to other features to a replacement of includes and using directives. In both cases, non-featured symbols do not compile.

Furthermore, *glbinding* provides explicit, non-feature dependent headers for special values (```values.h```), booleans (```boolean.h```), and basic types (```types.h```). This allows for refined includes and can reduce compile time.


##### Lazy Function Pointer Resolution

With the call of
```
glbinding::Binding::initialize(); // immediate function pointer resolution
```
*glbinding* tries to bind all known OpenGL function pointers, which can consume some time.
Alternatively, the user of *glbinding* can decide that all functions pointers are resolved when the function is used for the first time.
This is achieved by
```
glbinding::Binding::initialize(false); // lazy function pointer resolution
```

##### Multi-Context Support

*glbinding* has built-in support for multiple contexts.
The only requirement is, that you has to tell *glbinding* which context is currently active.
This feature mixes well with multi-threaded applications, but keep in mind that concurrent use of one context will not result in meaningful program behavior.
To use multiple contexts, use your favorite context creation library (e.g. Qt, egl, glfw, or platform specific solutions) to request as much contexts as you want to use.
The functions to make a context current should be provided by this library.
To use multiple contexts, you have to call
```
glbinding::Binding::initialize();
```
on each context while it is active and then you can switch between them either by using
```
glbinding::Binding::useCurrentContext(); // to use the current active context
glbinding::Binding::useContext(ContextHandle context); // to use another context, identified by the platform-specific identifier
```
The actual context switch has to be managed by yourself and you need to tell you context creating library which one you want to use and in addition to that, you have to tell *glbinding* which context is the active one, so function pointers can be correctly dispatched.
This feature is mainly required for Windows, as function pointers for different requested OpenGL features may vary.

##### Multi-Threading Support

The feature that requires concurrent use of *glbinding* will mainly be the usage of multiple OpenGL contexts in different threads (multiple threads operating on a single OpenGL context requires locking).
Therefor, *glbinding* supports multiple active contexts, one per thread.
This necessitate that *glbinding* gets informed in each thread which context is currently active.

##### Function Callbacks

ToDo
* Before and After Callbacks
* Callback Scopes
 * Global Function Callbacks (#global-callbacks)
 * Local Function Callbacks (#local-callbacks) 
* Parameter and Return Value Callbacks

Never forget glGetError() again
Logging all OpenGL calls


##### Meta Information

ToDo
* Meta information about the generated OpenGL binding and the OpenGL runtime
  * OpenGL extension support
    * Since when is an extension in the core profile?
    * Is an extension supported by the current context?
    * Collect all supported extensions as list of enums
  * GL symbol to string conversion
  * string to GL symbol conversion

e.g., allows e.g. to be accessed via scripts when turning on OPTION_GL_BY_STRINGS


##### Performance

ToDo . e.g. show output of comaprison example?


##### Binding Generation

ToDo

As a user of glbinding you are able to update the gl.xml by yourself and generate the glbinding code.
The necessary python scripts are provided in this repository.

Patching gl.xml 

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/hpicgs/glbinding/wiki) for detailed examples.
